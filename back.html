            <h6>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>One of yoga's most widely recognized poses, Adho Mukha Svanasana strengthens the core and improves circulation, while providing a delicious, full-body stretch.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose) is a foundational yoga posture that you’ll likely practice countless times throughout your yoga lifetime. <br>Because this pose is equal parts strengthening and stretching, practicing Down Dog
                can help to build better balance and flexibility throughout your whole body. Just be sure to practice it with care and attention: If you have stiff shoulders or hamstrings, the pose may feel challenging. If you’re flexible, you want to
                be cautious to avoid collapsing in your lower back and shoulders.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come onto your hands and knees, with your hands a tiny bit in front of your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Spread your palms, rooting down through all four corners of your hands, and turn your toes under.</li>
                <li>Exhale and lift your knees from the floor, at first keeping your knees slightly bent and your heels lifted off the floor. Lengthen your tailbone away from the back of your pelvis, lift the sitting bones toward the ceiling, and draw your
                    inner legs from your inner ankles up through your groins.</li>
                <li>On an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your knees without locking them.</li>
                <li>Firm your outer arms and press the bases of your index fingers actively into the floor. Lift along your inner arms from the wrists to the tops of the shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them
                    toward your tailbone. Keep your head between your upper arms.</li>
                <li>Stay in the pose for 10 or more breaths, then bend your knees on an exhalation and lower yourself into Child’s Pose.</li>

            <h6>Utthita Trikosana (Extended Triangle Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Extended Triangle Pose is a quintessential standing pose that stretches and strengthens the whole body.
                </q>
            </div>
            <p>Utthita Trikonasana can give you a healthy mix of grounded stability and heart-opening expansion of the chest. It stretches the hamstrings and back muscles while activating the abdominal muscles. This pose requires concentration and steady
                breath, which can help focus a wandering mind and bring you fully to the present moment.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>From Tadasana (Mountain Pose), step or lightly jump your feet 3 to 4 feet apart. Raise your arms parallel to the floor and reach them actively to the sides, shoulder blades wide, palms down.</li>
                <li>Turn your left foot in slightly and your right foot out to 90 degrees. Align your right heel with your left heel. Firm your thighs and rotate your right thigh outward, so the center of your right kneecap is in line with the center of the
                    right ankle.
                </li>
                <li>Exhale and extend your torso to the right, bending from your hip joint, not the waist. Reach out directly over the plane of the right leg. Counter the reach by anchoring your left hip to the left. (Imagine someone is trying to pull your
                    hips to the left.) Ground this movement by strengthening the left leg and pressing the outer heel firmly to the floor.</li>
                <li>When you have reached as far as you are able, hinge at the hip and bring the torso to the right, moving toward your upper body being parallel to the floor. Reach your right hand down toward the floor and stretch your left arm toward the
                    ceiling, in line with the tops of your shoulders. Your hands, arms and shoulders will form a straight line, perpendicular to your mat.</li>
                <li>Open your torso to the left, keeping the left and right sides of the torso equally long. Let the left hip come slightly forward and lengthen the tailbone toward the back heel.</li>
                <li>Rest your right hand on your shin, ankle, or the floor outside your right foot—whatever is possible without distorting the sides of the torso. Keep your head in a neutral position or turn it to the left, eyes gazing softly at the left
                    thumb or down at the floor.</li>
                <li>Stay in this pose for 30 to 60 seconds. Inhale to come up, strongly pressing the back heel into the floor and reaching the top arm toward the ceiling. Recenter, then reverse the feet and repeat for the same length of time on the other
                    side.
                </li>

            <h6>Salamba Bhujangasana (Sphinx Pose)</h6>
            <div class=" quoting ">
                <q>Sphinx Pose is the infant of backbends. It can be practiced with either an active or passive approach.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Salamba Bhujangasana (Sphinx Pose) is a gentle backbend pose that students are introduced to at the beginner level forming part of prone poses. The practice of Sphinx Pose is gentle on the lower back and forming part of the backbend yoga sequence,
                this pose also helps to open the chest acting as a heart opener.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your belly, legs side by side. Firm your tailbone toward your pubis and lengthen it toward your heels. Then, rotate your thighs inwardly by rolling your outer thighs toward the floor. This helps broaden and lengthen your lower back
                    and sacrum (the downward-facing triangular bone at the back of your pelvis) to protect it in a backbend.</li>
                <li>Reach actively through your toes to the wall behind you. As you move into the pose, be sure to continue lengthening your tail toward your heels to protect your lower back. Your buttocks should be firm but not clenched. While your legs
                    are active, your tongue, eyes, and brain should be quiet.</li>
                <li>Now set your elbows under your shoulders and your forearms on the floor parallel to each other. Inhale and lift your upper torso and head away from the floor into a mild backbend.</li>
                <li>The final step to building a solid foundation in Sphinx Pose is to bring awareness to your lower belly, the area just above the pubic bone and below the navel. Lightly draw it away from the floor to create a dome that rounds up toward
                    your lower back. This is very subtle—no sucking in, hardening, or rigidity required. This belly lift supports and distributes the curvature of your backbend more evenly along the length of the spine, soothing your lower back and awakening
                    your upper back.</li>
                <li>Stay for five to 10 breaths, then exhale and slowly release your belly and lower your torso and head to the floor. Turn your head to one side. Lie quietly for a while, broadening your back with each inhale, and releasing any tension with
                    each exhale. Repeat once or twice more if you like.</li>
            </ol>

            <h6>Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>By providing a conscious opening in the chest and stretch in the shoulders, Cobra Pose, called Bhujangasana in Sanskrit, fights fatigue and relieves lower back pain, boosting both the energetic and the physical body.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose) is a heart-opening backbend that stretches your entire upper body and can provide relief if you’re experiencing back pain, tightness in your shoulders, or upper body soreness.</p>
            <p>Cobra Pose can boost energy, fight fatigue, and build confidence. It improves posture and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting and computer work.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin on your belly with your feet hip-distance apart and your hands beside your ribs.</li>
                <li>Extend your big toes straight back and press down with all ten toenails to activate your quadriceps.</li>
                <li>Rotate your inner thighs toward the ceiling to broaden the lower back.</li>
                <li>Pressing down lightly with your hands, start to lift your head and chest, rolling your shoulders back and down.</li>
                <li>Keep the back of your neck long and focus on lifting your sternum instead of lifting your chin.</li>
                <li>Straighten your arms while keeping your shoulders remaining away from your ears. Keep at least a slight bend in your elbows.</li>
                <li>To exit the pose, release back to your mat.</li>

            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Setu Bandha Sarvangasana can be whatever you need—energizing, rejuvenating, or luxuriously restorative.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana) is one of the first back-bending yoga postures that many new students learn. And yet, much like the rest of an asana practice, it is also a posture from which you can continue learning for your entire
                lifetime.
                <br>This stalwart backbend can be performed restoratively or dynamically—as a resting pose or a strengthener. It will allow you to gain the deep emotional and physical benefits of opening up your chest and thoracic spine.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your back in the center of your mat with your knees bent, your legs and feet parallel and hip-distance apart.</li>
                <li>Move your feet closer to your buttocks. Press down firmly through both of your feet and inhale to raise your hips, lifting from the pubic bone rather than the navel.</li>
                <li>Clasp your hands under your back on the floor. Broaden your collarbones and get on top of your shoulders. Firm the outer shins and roll your upper thighs inward. Press down firmly through your heels and lift the back of your thighs and
                    the bottom of your buttocks even higher while keeping the thighs parallel.</li>
                <li>To finish, exhale, release your hands, and lower to the floor. Allow your back to rest in a neutral state as you observe the spaciousness within your chest.</li>
