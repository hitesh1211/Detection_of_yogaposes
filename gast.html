            <h1>Few poses for releasing abdominal gas</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="asana">
            <h6>Pawanmuktasana (Wind release pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Pawanmuktasana is pronounced as PUH-vuhn-mukt-AAHS-uh-nuh.<br>Pavana = wind, mukta = relieve or release, Asana = Posture or Pose
                </q>
            </div>
            <p>Pawanmuktasana, as the name suggests, derives itself from two words “Pawan”, meaning wind or gas, and “Mukta”, meaning release or relief. This asana helps by releasing the gas in our stomach. Gas often occurs due to food indigestion. And indigestion
                causes a lot of problems, more than stomach discomfort like migraine, joint pain, etc.<br>It helps in getting rid of the gas formed due to indigestion and also works on the muscles of the back, biceps, triceps, and hips</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, lie down supine on a mat. Stretch your arms, legs, and take a few breaths. This is the initial pose. The asana is named Savasana.</li>
                <li>Flex your knees so that your legs make a 90° angle with your thighs.</li>
                <li>With an exhale, bring your knees close to your chest.</li>
                <li>Simultaneously raise your head to bring it close to the knees.</li>
                <li>Hold on to this stance for a few seconds and then release.</li>
                <li>Keep the breathing normal while you hold the posture.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="asana">
            <h6>Halasana (Plow Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Also called Seated Twist Pose or Ardha Matsyendrasana in Sanskrit, this pose energizes the spine and stimulate proper digestion while improving postural and body awareness.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Halasana, a full-body stretch that positions your body upside down with your feet over your head, offers interesting new perspectives. Practice it before settling into meditation, pranayama, Savasana (Corpse Pose), or before going to sleep.<br>Regular
                practice of Halasana stretches the thoracic, lumbar, and cervical regions of the spine, increasing circulation and suppleness. This posture can relieve backache, stretch the shoulders, and lengthen the spine. It can also reduce phlegm
                or mucus in the sinuses and respiratory system, and gradually lengthens and regulates the breath.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stack three blankets so that their edges line up. Place the stack near the front of your mat so that their edges line up near the middle of the mat.</li>
                <li>Sit at the front end of your mat and lie back over the blankets so they support your torso. Adjust your position so that the tops of your shoulders are about an inch over the edge and the back your head rests on the floor. Lie face up
                    so that the front of your neck is long and there’s space between the back of your neck and the floor.</li>
                <li>Bring your knees toward your chest, then straighten your legs toward the ceiling.</li>
                <li>Using the strength of your abs—and supporting yourself with both hands at your low or mid back—lift your hips off the floor and roll up until you are supported by your shoulders. Stack your hips above your shoulders.</li>
                <li>Slowly lower your legs backward over your head until your toes reach the ground behind you. Rest your toes on the ground, feet flexed.</li>
                <li>Release your hands and place your arms no the floor, palms down or with hands clasped. Press down with your outer upper arms and shoulders to create more lift along the spine.</li>
                <li>Hold for 5 breaths or more.</li>
                <li>To exit, unclasp your hands, press your arms and hands into the mat, and slowly roll down one vertebrae at a time.</li>
                <li>Take a few moments to allow the back to settle back into its normal curves.</li>

            <h6>Supta Matsyendrasana (Supine Spinal Twist)</h6>
            <div class=" quoting ">
                <q>Supta, meaning supine or reclined, Matsya, meaning fish, indra, meaning ruler, and asana, meaning pose.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Supta Matsyendrasana is a restorative spinal twist, that lengthens and strengthens the spine while detoxifying the internal organs. Supta Matsyendrasana is a gentle posture that stretches the spine, shoulder, back, thighs, and neck and stimulates
                internal detoxifying processes, all while the body rests.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your back with your arms stretched horizontally out to the sides in line with the shoulders.</li>
                <li>Extend your left leg out in front of you and bend your right knee, hugging it into your chest.</li>
                <li>Inhale, and on an exhale slowly cross your right knee over your midline and onto the floor on the left side of your body. Turn your head to the right and look at your right palm.</li>
                <li>Make sure that both of your shoulder blades are touching the ground, even if that means your knee does not fully touch the floor. While twisting, there is a tendency for one shoulder blade to lift off of the ground.</li>
                <li>Feel the stretch in your thighs, groin, arms, neck, stomach and back as you hold the pose. With each exhalation, relax deeper into the pose.</li>
                <li>Hold for several minutes.</li>
                <li>Slowly turn your head back to the center and straighten your torso and legs.</li>
                <li>Repeat the pose on your left side</li>

        <div class="asana">
            <h6>Balasana (Child’s Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Take a break. Balasana is a restful pose that can be sequenced between more challenging asanas.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Balasana centers on creating a moment of rest or respite. It is a foundational yoga posture that remings us that inaction and "non-doing" can be just as valuable as action and doing. It's a chance to stop what you are doing, reassess your
                position, reconnect with your breath, and prepare yourself to move forward. Child's Pose is a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles. It can help relieve back pain.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come to your hands and knees on the mat.</li>
                <li>Spread your knees as wide as your mat, keeping the tops of your feet on the floor with the big toes touching.
                </li>
                <li>Bring your belly to rest between your thighs and root your forehead to the floor. Relax the shoulders, jaw, and eyes. If it is not comfortable to place the forehead on the floor, rest it on a block or two stacked fists. There is an energy
                    point at the center of the forehead in between the eyebrows that stimulates the vagus nerve and supports a "rest and digest" response. Finding a comfortable place for the forehead is key to gaining this soothing benefit.</li>
                <li>There are several possible arm variations. You can stretch your arms in front of you with the palms toward the floor or bring your arms back alongside your thighs with the palms facing upwards. These are the most common variations. But
                    you can also stretch the arms forward with palms facing up for a shoulder release or try bending the elbows so that the palms touch and rest the thumbs at the back of the neck. In this position inch the elbows forward.</li>
                <li>Do whichever feel more comfortable for you. If you've been doing a lot of shoulder work, the second option feels nice.</li>
                <li>Stay as long as you like, eventually reconnecting with the steady inhales and exhales of your breath.</li>

            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Fold into Paschimottanasana to help your distracted mind—and your hamstrings—unwind.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend) is a foundational pose that many yoga practitioners breeze past. But extending the top half of the body over the seated lower half helps stretch the entire back of you body to enhance your physical flexibility.
                Folding inward in this way also brings mental calm.<br>In addition to calming your mind and relieving stress, this pose stretches your spine, shoulders, and hamstrings. It also stimulates the liver, kidneys, ovaries, and uterus—and can
                help improve digestion.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin in Dandasana (Staff Pose), sitting on the edge of a folded blanket. Press your heels away from your body; press your palms or finger tips into the floor beside your hips.</li>
                <li>Inhale. Keeping your front torso long, exhale and lean forward from your hips. Lengthen the spine to fold toward your legs, without rounding your back.</li>
                <li>Walk your hands out along the outside of each leg as far as they will go. If you can reach them, hold the sides of your feet with your hands.</li>
                <li>With each inhalation, lift and lengthen your front torso just slightly; with each exhalation, release a little more fully into the forward bend. If you are holding your feet, bend your elbows out to the sides and lift them away from the
                    floor.
                </li>
                <li>Stay in the pose from 1–3 minutes. To come up, release your feet. Inhale and lift your torso by pulling your tailbone down and into the pelvis.</li>
            </ol>
