            <h6>Ustrasana (Camel Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Bump up your energy (and confidence!) by bending back into Camel Pose. Ustrasana counteracts slouching and relieves lower back pain with a generous, heart-opening stretch.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Camel Pose (Ustrasana) is an energizing and beneficial backbend—a welcome, heart-opening addition to your sequence that counteracts slouching and relieves lower back pain. It’s worth taking the time to do it well. The main thing to avoid with
                Ustrasana is flopping into the pose and taking the brunt of the backbend in your neck or lower back. Instead, lift and lengthen your torso before you gently arch into the pose. Keep some length and space along the back of the neck and
                the low back.
                <br>Camel Pose can help build confidence and empowerment. It improves your posture and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting, slouching, and kyphosis (abnormal curvature of the spine). It may also help relieve back pain. Camel Pose
                stretches your abdomen, chest, shoulders, the front of your hips (hip flexors), and the front of your thighs (quadriceps). </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come to your knees, with your legs hip-width apart. Keep your hips over your knees and squeeze your thighs toward each other.</li>
                <li>Inhale, engage your lower belly, and reach your tailbone toward your knees, creating space between your lower vertebrae.</li>
                <li>On another inhalation, lift your sternum and draw your elbows back, toward each other behind you. Allow your rib cage to expand.</li>
                <li>Keep your chest raised, your core engaged, your spine long, your chin tucked and your shoulders back as you drop your hands toward your heels.</li>
                <li>Press the heels of your hands into the heels of your feet, draping the fingers over the soles. Keep lifting through your sternum. (If you don’t have the spinal flexibility for full Ustrasana, avoid reaching for your feet; instead, use
                    blocks placed on the outside of each ankle or keep your hands on your hips with your thumbs on your sacrum.)</li>
                <li>Now lift your shoulders to allow the trapezius muscles between the shoulder blades to rise up and cushion your cervical spine. Gently allow the head and neck to extend backward. Gaze at the tip of your nose.</li>
                <li>Stay in this pose for 30 to 60 seconds. To exit, bring your chin to your chest and your hands to your hips with your thumbs on your sacrum. Engage your lower belly and use your hands to support your lower back as you come slowly back up
                    to your knees.</li>

            </div>
            <p>Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Lord of the Fishes Pose/Seated Twist Pose) is a deep, restorative twist that is both strengthening and rejuvenating. Your entire torso twists in the pose, which improves circulation, helps with digestion, and improves
                spinal mobility.<br>Half Lord of the Fishes is good for stretching your outer hips and thighs, opening your shoulders and chest, building strength in your upper back, lengthening your spine, and stretching the front of your thighs. It
                can also help stimulate digestion.

                <li>Turn your head to the right, looking past your right shoulder. Make sure you don’t strain your neck.</li>
                <li>Breath as you hold the pose, lengthening on each inhale and gently twisting a bit more with each exhale.</li>
                <li>To exit the pose, inhale to reach the right arm up and unwind the body. Exhale to release back to center. Repeat on the other side.</li>

            <div class=" quoting ">
                <q>'Shashank' is a Sankrit word which means moon.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Shashankasana or the Rabbit pose is so-called as the asana resembles a Rabbit in the final position. There are many benefits of this asana including relaxation, relieving of depression, and much more. Age or flexibility is one of the barriers
                to perform or practice asana but Shashankasana is one of those which is very easy to perform and can be done by anyone regardless of age.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit down on the floor with a simple or yoga mat.</li>
                <li>Stretch your leg in front and keep your spine erect.</li>
                <li>Bend your right leg by your knee, bring it back and keep your right buttock on your foot.</li>
                <li>Now bend your left leg by your knee, bring it back and keep your left buttock on your foot.</li>
                <li>Keep your right foot big toe on the left foot big toe.</li>
                <li>Sit comfortably in Vajrasana and keep your palms on your thighs.</li>

                <li>Stay in this position as long as possible.</li>

            <h6>Balasana (Child’s Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Take a break. Balasana is a restful pose that can be sequenced between more challenging asanas.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Balasana centers on creating a moment of rest or respite. It is a foundational yoga posture that remings us that inaction and "non-doing" can be just as valuable as action and doing. It's a chance to stop what you are doing, reassess your
                position, reconnect with your breath, and prepare yourself to move forward. Child's Pose is a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles. It can help relieve back pain.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come to your hands and knees on the mat.</li>
                <li>Spread your knees as wide as your mat, keeping the tops of your feet on the floor with the big toes touching.
                </li>
                <li>Bring your belly to rest between your thighs and root your forehead to the floor. Relax the shoulders, jaw, and eyes. If it is not comfortable to place the forehead on the floor, rest it on a block or two stacked fists. There is an energy
                    point at the center of the forehead in between the eyebrows that stimulates the vagus nerve and supports a "rest and digest" response. Finding a comfortable place for the forehead is key to gaining this soothing benefit.</li>
                <li>There are several possible arm variations. You can stretch your arms in front of you with the palms toward the floor or bring your arms back alongside your thighs with the palms facing upwards. These are the most common variations. But
                    you can also stretch the arms forward with palms facing up for a shoulder release or try bending the elbows so that the palms touch and rest the thumbs at the back of the neck. In this position inch the elbows forward.</li>
                <li>Do whichever feel more comfortable for you. If you've been doing a lot of shoulder work, the second option feels nice.</li>
                <li>Stay as long as you like, eventually reconnecting with the steady inhales and exhales of your breath.</li>

            </div>
            <p>If you’re among the millions of people glued to a desk for hours upon hours every day, then you need Dhanurasana (Bow Pose) in your life. This heart-opening backbend stretches your hip flexors and hamstrings (aka the muscles that are shortened
                and tightened, respectively, from all that sitting) while strengthening your back. It helps improve your posture by opening your chest and shoulders, counteracting the time you spend hunched over your computer.<br>Like all backbends, Bow
                Pose is energizing and stimulates the adrenal glands that sit above each kidney. It also increases blood flow to your digestive system.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your belly on your mat, with a blanket under your pelvis if needed. Press all of your toes into the floor and then bend your knees, keeping the toes active.</li>
                <li>Grab the outer edges of your ankles with your hands and flex your feet strongly.</li>
                <li>On an inhalation, lift your rib cage and shoulders toward your ears. On an exhalation, lengthen your tailbone and kick your legs back into your hands as you hold on firmly.</li>
                <li>From here, lift your head and heart. Gaze forward. Extend through the roof of your mouth and crown of your head. As you do so, always keep strong energy moving from the base of your spine through the crown of your head to help support.
                </li>
                <li>Stay lifted for 5 breaths.</li>
