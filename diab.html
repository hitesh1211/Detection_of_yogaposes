            <h6>Balasana (Child’s Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Take a break. Balasana is a restful pose that can be sequenced between more challenging asanas.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Balasana centers on creating a moment of rest or respite. It is a foundational yoga posture that remings us that inaction and "non-doing" can be just as valuable as action and doing. It's a chance to stop what you are doing, reassess your
                position, reconnect with your breath, and prepare yourself to move forward. Child's Pose is a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles. It can help relieve back pain.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come to your hands and knees on the mat.</li>
                <li>Spread your knees as wide as your mat, keeping the tops of your feet on the floor with the big toes touching.
                </li>
                <li>Bring your belly to rest between your thighs and root your forehead to the floor. Relax the shoulders, jaw, and eyes. If it is not comfortable to place the forehead on the floor, rest it on a block or two stacked fists. There is an energy
                    point at the center of the forehead in between the eyebrows that stimulates the vagus nerve and supports a "rest and digest" response. Finding a comfortable place for the forehead is key to gaining this soothing benefit.</li>
                <li>There are several possible arm variations. You can stretch your arms in front of you with the palms toward the floor or bring your arms back alongside your thighs with the palms facing upwards. These are the most common variations. But
                    you can also stretch the arms forward with palms facing up for a shoulder release or try bending the elbows so that the palms touch and rest the thumbs at the back of the neck. In this position inch the elbows forward.</li>
                <li>Do whichever feel more comfortable for you. If you've been doing a lot of shoulder work, the second option feels nice.</li>
                <li>Stay as long as you like, eventually reconnecting with the steady inhales and exhales of your breath.</li>
            </ol>

            <h6>Vrikshasana (Tree Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Also called Seated Twist Pose or Ardha Matsyendrasana in Sanskrit, this pose energizes the spine and stimulate proper digestion while improving postural and body awareness.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Vrikshasana teaches you to simultaneously press down and feel rooted as you reach tall like the branches of a mighty tree. In this pose, you find a sense of groundedness through the strength of your standing leg. Bringing the sole of your
                opposite foot to your shin or thigh challenges your balance. Continuously engage your ankles, legs, and core and notice what tiny movements your body might make to help you stay balanced. <br>By strengthening your legs, glutes, core, and
                back, Tree Pose can improve your posture and alignment, which is especially helpful if you sit throughout the day.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand in Tadasana. Spread your toes, press your feet into the mat and firm your leg muscles. Raise your front hip points toward your lower ribs to gently lift in your lower belly.</li>
                <li>Inhale deeply, lifting your chest, and exhale as you draw your shoulder blades down your back. Look straight ahead at a steady gazing spot.</li>
                <li>Place your hands on your hips and raise your right foot high onto your left thigh or shin. Avoid making contact with the knee.</li>
                <li>Press your right foot and left leg into each other.</li>
                <li>Check that your pelvis is level and squared to the front.</li>
                <li>When you feel steady, place your hands into Anjali Mudra at the heart or stretch your arms overhead like branches reaching into the sun.</li>
                <li>Hold for several breaths, then step back into Mountain Pose and repeat on the other side.</li>

            <h6>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose)</h6>
            <div class=" quoting ">
                <q>One of yoga's most widely recognized poses, Adho Mukha Svanasana strengthens the core and improves circulation, while providing a delicious, full-body stretch.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose) is a foundational yoga posture that you’ll likely practice countless times throughout your yoga lifetime. <br>Because this pose is equal parts strengthening and stretching, practicing Down Dog
                can help to build better balance and flexibility throughout your whole body. Just be sure to practice it with care and attention: If you have stiff shoulders or hamstrings, the pose may feel challenging. If you’re flexible, you want to
                be cautious to avoid collapsing in your lower back and shoulders.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come onto your hands and knees, with your hands a tiny bit in front of your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Spread your palms, rooting down through all four corners of your hands, and turn your toes under.</li>
                <li>Exhale and lift your knees from the floor, at first keeping your knees slightly bent and your heels lifted off the floor. Lengthen your tailbone away from the back of your pelvis, lift the sitting bones toward the ceiling, and draw your
                    inner legs from your inner ankles up through your groins.</li>
                <li>On an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your knees without locking them.</li>
                <li>Firm your outer arms and press the bases of your index fingers actively into the floor. Lift along your inner arms from the wrists to the tops of the shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them
                    toward your tailbone. Keep your head between your upper arms.</li>
                <li>Stay in the pose for 10 or more breaths, then bend your knees on an exhalation and lower yourself into Child’s Pose.</li>

                <q>Fold into Paschimottanasana to help your distracted mind—and your hamstrings—unwind.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend) is a foundational pose that many yoga practitioners breeze past. But extending the top half of the body over the seated lower half helps stretch the entire back of you body to enhance your physical flexibility.
                Folding inward in this way also brings mental calm.<br>In addition to calming your mind and relieving stress, this pose stretches your spine, shoulders, and hamstrings. It also stimulates the liver, kidneys, ovaries, and uterus—and can
                help improve digestion.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin in Dandasana (Staff Pose), sitting on the edge of a folded blanket. Press your heels away from your body; press your palms or finger tips into the floor beside your hips.</li>
                <li>Inhale. Keeping your front torso long, exhale and lean forward from your hips. Lengthen the spine to fold toward your legs, without rounding your back.</li>
                <li>Walk your hands out along the outside of each leg as far as they will go. If you can reach them, hold the sides of your feet with your hands.</li>
                <li>With each inhalation, lift and lengthen your front torso just slightly; with each exhalation, release a little more fully into the forward bend. If you are holding your feet, bend your elbows out to the sides and lift them away from the
                    floor.
                </li>
                <li>Stay in the pose from 1–3 minutes. To come up, release your feet. Inhale and lift your torso by pulling your tailbone down and into the pelvis.</li>

                <q>Bend back into the shape of a bow to feel energetically locked, loaded, and ready to take aim.
                </q>
            </div>
            <p>If you’re among the millions of people glued to a desk for hours upon hours every day, then you need Dhanurasana (Bow Pose) in your life. This heart-opening backbend stretches your hip flexors and hamstrings (aka the muscles that are shortened
                and tightened, respectively, from all that sitting) while strengthening your back. It helps improve your posture by opening your chest and shoulders, counteracting the time you spend hunched over your computer.<br>Like all backbends, Bow
                Pose is energizing and stimulates the adrenal glands that sit above each kidney. It also increases blood flow to your digestive system.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your belly on your mat, with a blanket under your pelvis if needed. Press all of your toes into the floor and then bend your knees, keeping the toes active.</li>
                <li>Grab the outer edges of your ankles with your hands and flex your feet strongly.</li>
                <li>On an inhalation, lift your rib cage and shoulders toward your ears. On an exhalation, lengthen your tailbone and kick your legs back into your hands as you hold on firmly.</li>
                <li>From here, lift your head and heart. Gaze forward. Extend through the roof of your mouth and crown of your head. As you do so, always keep strong energy moving from the base of your spine through the crown of your head to help support.
                </li>
                <li>Stay lifted for 5 breaths.</li>
            </ol>
