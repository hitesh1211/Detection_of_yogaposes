            <h6>Salamba Sarvangasana (Supported Shoulderstand)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>This version of Shoulderstand is performed with blanket support under the shoulders.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Sarvangasana, Shoulder stand, or more fully Salamba Sarvangasana, is an inverted asana in modern yoga as exercise; similar poses were used in medieval hatha yoga. Many named variations exist, including with legs in lotus position and Supta
                Konasana with legs wide apart, toes on the ground.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fold two or more firm blankets into rectangles measuring about 1 foot by 2 feet, and stack them one on top of the other. You can place a sticky mat over the blankets to help the upper arms stay in place while in the pose. Then lie on the
                    blankets with your shoulders supported (and parallel to one of the longer edges) and your head on the floor. Lay your arms on the floor alongside your torso, then bend your knees and set your feet against the floor with the heels close
                    to the sitting bones. Exhale, press your arms against the floor, and push your feet away from the floor, drawing your thighs into the front torso.</li>
                <li>Continue to lift by curling the pelvis and then the back torso away from the floor, so that your knees come toward your face. Stretch your arms out parallel to the edge of the blanket and turn them outward so the fingers press against
                    the floor (and the thumbs point behind you). Bend your elbows and draw them toward each other. Lay the backs of your upper arms on the blanket and spread your palms against the back of your torso. Raise your pelvis over the shoulders,
                    so that the torso is relatively perpendicular to the floor. Walk your hands up your back (toward the floor) without letting the elbows slide too much wider than shoulder width.</li>
                <li>Inhale and lift your bent knees toward the ceiling, bringing your thighs in line with your torso and hanging the heels down by your buttocks. Press your tailbone toward your pubis and turn the upper thighs inward slightly. Finally inhale
                    and straighten the knees, pressing the heels up toward the ceiling. When the backs of the legs are fully lengthened, lift through the balls of the big toes so the inner legs are slightly longer than the outer.</li>
                <li>Soften the throat and tongue. Firm the shoulder blades against the back, and move the sternum toward the chin. Your forehead should be relatively parallel to the floor, your chin perpendicular. Press the backs of your upper arms and the
                    tops of your shoulders actively into the blanket support, and try to lift the upper spine away from the floor. Gaze softly at your chest.</li>
                <li>As a beginning practitioner stay in the pose for about 30 seconds. Gradually add 5 to 10 seconds to your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold the pose for 3 minutes. Then continue for 3 minutes each day for a week or two,
                    until you feel relatively comfortable in the pose. Again gradually and 5 to 10 seconds onto your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold the pose for 5 minutes. To come down, exhale, bend your knees into your torso again,
                    and roll your back torso slowly and carefully onto the floor, keeping the back of your head on the floor.</li>

            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Setu Bandha Sarvangasana can be whatever you need—energizing, rejuvenating, or luxuriously restorative.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana) is one of the first back-bending yoga postures that many new students learn. And yet, much like the rest of an asana practice, it is also a posture from which you can continue learning for your entire
                lifetime.
                <br>This stalwart backbend can be performed restoratively or dynamically—as a resting pose or a strengthener. It will allow you to gain the deep emotional and physical benefits of opening up your chest and thoracic spine.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your back in the center of your mat with your knees bent, your legs and feet parallel and hip-distance apart.</li>
                <li>Move your feet closer to your buttocks. Press down firmly through both of your feet and inhale to raise your hips, lifting from the pubic bone rather than the navel.</li>
                <li>Clasp your hands under your back on the floor. Broaden your collarbones and get on top of your shoulders. Firm the outer shins and roll your upper thighs inward. Press down firmly through your heels and lift the back of your thighs and
                    the bottom of your buttocks even higher while keeping the thighs parallel.</li>
                <li>To finish, exhale, release your hands, and lower to the floor. Allow your back to rest in a neutral state as you observe the spaciousness within your chest.</li>

            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Bend back into the shape of a bow to feel energetically locked, loaded, and ready to take aim.
                </q>
            </div>
            <p>If you’re among the millions of people glued to a desk for hours upon hours every day, then you need Dhanurasana (Bow Pose) in your life. This heart-opening backbend stretches your hip flexors and hamstrings (aka the muscles that are shortened
                and tightened, respectively, from all that sitting) while strengthening your back. It helps improve your posture by opening your chest and shoulders, counteracting the time you spend hunched over your computer.<br>Like all backbends, Bow
                Pose is energizing and stimulates the adrenal glands that sit above each kidney. It also increases blood flow to your digestive system.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lie on your belly on your mat, with a blanket under your pelvis if needed. Press all of your toes into the floor and then bend your knees, keeping the toes active.</li>
                <li>Grab the outer edges of your ankles with your hands and flex your feet strongly.</li>
                <li>On an inhalation, lift your rib cage and shoulders toward your ears. On an exhalation, lengthen your tailbone and kick your legs back into your hands as you hold on firmly.</li>
                <li>From here, lift your head and heart. Gaze forward. Extend through the roof of your mouth and crown of your head. As you do so, always keep strong energy moving from the base of your spine through the crown of your head to help support.
                </li>
                <li>Stay lifted for 5 breaths.</li>

                <q>Also called Seated Twist Pose or Ardha Matsyendrasana in Sanskrit, this pose energizes the spine and stimulate proper digestion while improving postural and body awareness.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Halasana, a full-body stretch that positions your body upside down with your feet over your head, offers interesting new perspectives. Practice it before settling into meditation, pranayama, Savasana (Corpse Pose), or before going to sleep.<br>Regular
                practice of Halasana stretches the thoracic, lumbar, and cervical regions of the spine, increasing circulation and suppleness. This posture can relieve backache, stretch the shoulders, and lengthen the spine. It can also reduce phlegm
                or mucus in the sinuses and respiratory system, and gradually lengthens and regulates the breath.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stack three blankets so that their edges line up. Place the stack near the front of your mat so that their edges line up near the middle of the mat.</li>
                <li>Sit at the front end of your mat and lie back over the blankets so they support your torso. Adjust your position so that the tops of your shoulders are about an inch over the edge and the back your head rests on the floor. Lie face up
                    so that the front of your neck is long and there’s space between the back of your neck and the floor.</li>
                <li>Bring your knees toward your chest, then straighten your legs toward the ceiling.</li>
                <li>Using the strength of your abs—and supporting yourself with both hands at your low or mid back—lift your hips off the floor and roll up until you are supported by your shoulders. Stack your hips above your shoulders.</li>
                <li>Slowly lower your legs backward over your head until your toes reach the ground behind you. Rest your toes on the ground, feet flexed.</li>
                <li>Release your hands and place your arms no the floor, palms down or with hands clasped. Press down with your outer upper arms and shoulders to create more lift along the spine.</li>
                <li>Hold for 5 breaths or more.</li>
                <li>To exit, unclasp your hands, press your arms and hands into the mat, and slowly roll down one vertebrae at a time.</li>
                <li>Take a few moments to allow the back to settle back into its normal curves.</li>

            <h6>Viparita Karani (Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>There's a general consensus among modern yogis that Viparita Karani or Legs-Up-The-Wall Pose may have the power to cure whatever ails you.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Legs-up-the-Wall Pose is calming and relaxing. It improves circulation and can help reduce swelling lower extremities by redirecting lymph and other fluids from your ankles, knees, and pelvic organs to your upper body and head. It activates
                the relaxation response (parasympathetic nervous system) and deactivates the stress response (sympathetic nervous system).</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on the floor facing a wall. Lower your shoulders and head to the floor, lying on your side. Then roll onto your back and stretch your legs up the wall, with your feet hip-distance apart or whatever distance feels comfortable.</li>
                <li>Adjust your position by scooting your tailbone toward the wall. It doesn’t need to touch the wall.</li>
                <li>Find a comfortable position for your arms at your side, with palms turned up; relax your arms and shoulders. Relax your legs against the wall. Release all effort. You might feel your femurs sink into your hip sockets. Feel the spine lengthening.
                    Settle into the pose and breathe for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>To come out of the pose, bend your knees and roll to your side. Remain here for a few breaths before using the strength of your arms to slowly push yourself back up to seated.</li>
