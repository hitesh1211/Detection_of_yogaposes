            <h6>Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>By providing a conscious opening in the chest and stretch in the shoulders, Cobra Pose, called Bhujangasana in Sanskrit, fights fatigue and relieves lower back pain, boosting both the energetic and the physical body.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose) is a heart-opening backbend that stretches your entire upper body and can provide relief if you’re experiencing back pain, tightness in your shoulders, or upper body soreness.</p>
            <p>Cobra Pose can boost energy, fight fatigue, and build confidence. It improves posture and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting and computer work.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin on your belly with your feet hip-distance apart and your hands beside your ribs.</li>
                <li>Extend your big toes straight back and press down with all ten toenails to activate your quadriceps.</li>
                <li>Rotate your inner thighs toward the ceiling to broaden the lower back.</li>
                <li>Pressing down lightly with your hands, start to lift your head and chest, rolling your shoulders back and down.</li>
                <li>Keep the back of your neck long and focus on lifting your sternum instead of lifting your chin.</li>
                <li>Straighten your arms while keeping your shoulders remaining away from your ears. Keep at least a slight bend in your elbows.</li>
                <li>To exit the pose, release back to your mat.</li>

            <h6>Mandukasana (Frog Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>In Sanskrit the word “Manduk” means frog.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Mandukasana, or Frog posture is a group of seated asanas in Hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise, all of which put the body in a shape like that of a frog. Another frog-like posture is Bhekasana.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Comfortably sit in Vajrasana (thunderbolt pose)</li>
                <li>Close the fists of both hands.</li>
                <li>While clenching the fists press your thumb inside with the fingers.</li>
                <li>While pressing the navel with your both fists exhale and bend forward.</li>
                <li>Hold the breath when you are in the position of bend forward and keep looking straight.</li>
                <li>Stay in this position for some time (hold the position as much as you can), inhale, and come back to the starting position (Vajrasana).</li>
                <li>Repeat this three to four times.</li>

            <h6>Halasana (Plow Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Also called Seated Twist Pose or Ardha Matsyendrasana in Sanskrit, this pose energizes the spine and stimulate proper digestion while improving postural and body awareness.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Halasana, a full-body stretch that positions your body upside down with your feet over your head, offers interesting new perspectives. Practice it before settling into meditation, pranayama, Savasana (Corpse Pose), or before going to sleep.<br>Regular
                practice of Halasana stretches the thoracic, lumbar, and cervical regions of the spine, increasing circulation and suppleness. This posture can relieve backache, stretch the shoulders, and lengthen the spine. It can also reduce phlegm
                or mucus in the sinuses and respiratory system, and gradually lengthens and regulates the breath.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stack three blankets so that their edges line up. Place the stack near the front of your mat so that their edges line up near the middle of the mat.</li>
                <li>Sit at the front end of your mat and lie back over the blankets so they support your torso. Adjust your position so that the tops of your shoulders are about an inch over the edge and the back your head rests on the floor. Lie face up
                    so that the front of your neck is long and there’s space between the back of your neck and the floor.</li>
                <li>Bring your knees toward your chest, then straighten your legs toward the ceiling.</li>
                <li>Using the strength of your abs—and supporting yourself with both hands at your low or mid back—lift your hips off the floor and roll up until you are supported by your shoulders. Stack your hips above your shoulders.</li>
                <li>Slowly lower your legs backward over your head until your toes reach the ground behind you. Rest your toes on the ground, feet flexed.</li>
                <li>Release your hands and place your arms no the floor, palms down or with hands clasped. Press down with your outer upper arms and shoulders to create more lift along the spine.</li>
                <li>Hold for 5 breaths or more.</li>
                <li>To exit, unclasp your hands, press your arms and hands into the mat, and slowly roll down one vertebrae at a time.</li>
                <li>Take a few moments to allow the back to settle back into its normal curves.</li>

            <h6>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>One of yoga's most widely recognized poses, Adho Mukha Svanasana strengthens the core and improves circulation, while providing a delicious, full-body stretch.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose) is a foundational yoga posture that you’ll likely practice countless times throughout your yoga lifetime. <br>Because this pose is equal parts strengthening and stretching, practicing Down Dog
                can help to build better balance and flexibility throughout your whole body. Just be sure to practice it with care and attention: If you have stiff shoulders or hamstrings, the pose may feel challenging. If you’re flexible, you want to
                be cautious to avoid collapsing in your lower back and shoulders.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Come onto your hands and knees, with your hands a tiny bit in front of your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Spread your palms, rooting down through all four corners of your hands, and turn your toes under.</li>
                <li>Exhale and lift your knees from the floor, at first keeping your knees slightly bent and your heels lifted off the floor. Lengthen your tailbone away from the back of your pelvis, lift the sitting bones toward the ceiling, and draw your
                    inner legs from your inner ankles up through your groins.</li>
                <li>On an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your knees without locking them.</li>
                <li>Firm your outer arms and press the bases of your index fingers actively into the floor. Lift along your inner arms from the wrists to the tops of the shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them
                    toward your tailbone. Keep your head between your upper arms.</li>
                <li>Stay in the pose for 10 or more breaths, then bend your knees on an exhalation and lower yourself into Child’s Pose.</li>

            <h6>Gomukhasana (Cow Face Pose)</h6>
            <div class=" quoting ">
                <q>Can't see the cow face? Notice that the crossed legs look like the lips. The bent-elbow arms, one up and one down, are the ears.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Gomukhasana stretches your entire body—your shoulders and arms, your ankles, hips, thighs and back. In the pose, the folded legs are said to resemble a cow’s mouth; the elbows form the shape of a cow’s ears.</p>
            <p>It’s a pose that allows you many opportunities to explore the symmetry of the body. When you cross one knee over the other, notice a difference in how it feels right over left versus left over right. Similarly, the arm position will tell you
                instantly if one shoulder is tighter than the other.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start in Dandasana (Staff Pose), then cross your right leg over your left, stacking knee on top of knee and bringing your right heel to the outside of your left hip.</li>
                <li>Bend your left knee, bringing your left heel to the outside of your right hip.</li>
                <li>With your knees stacked and centered, press down evenly with your sitting bones.</li>
                <li>Elongate your spine and lift out of your lower back.</li>
                <li>Inhale, take your right arm out to the side and rotate it so your palm faces back and your thumb points down.</li>
                <li>As you exhale, bend your elbow and bring your right arm behind your back, with your palm facing out and the upper arm pulled in close to your body. Your elbow points towards your sacrum and your right fingers point towards the base of
                    your neck.</li>
                <li>With your next inhale, take your left arm out to the side and up to the ceiling with your hand facing the midline.</li>
                <li>Bend your left elbow and reach your hand down toward your neck. Bring your elbow in close to your face and up toward the ceiling as your hand reaches down the spine.</li>
                <li>Reach your hands toward each other until they touch. Clasp hands or fingers if possible.</li>
                <li>To exit the pose, exhale and carefully release your arms out to your sides and return to Dandasana.</li>
                <li>Repeat on the opposite side.</li>
            </ol>
