            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Also called Seated Twist Pose or Ardha Matsyendrasana in Sanskrit, this pose energizes the spine and stimulate proper digestion while improving postural and body awareness.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Lord of the Fishes Pose/Seated Twist Pose) is a deep, restorative twist that is both strengthening and rejuvenating. Your entire torso twists in the pose, which improves circulation, helps with digestion, and improves
                spinal mobility.<br>Half Lord of the Fishes is good for stretching your outer hips and thighs, opening your shoulders and chest, building strength in your upper back, lengthening your spine, and stretching the front of your thighs. It

            </div>
            <p>Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose) is a heart-opening backbend that stretches your entire upper body and can provide relief if you’re experiencing back pain, tightness in your shoulders, or upper body soreness.</p>
            <p>Cobra Pose can boost energy, fight fatigue, and build confidence. It improves posture and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting and computer work.</p>

            <div class=" quoting ">
                <q>Badha = Bound or Restrained, Kona = Angle, Asana = Pose or Posture.</q>
            </div>
            <p>The posture is named Badhakonasana because of the way it is carried out – both the feet tucked close to the groin, clasped tightly with the hands as though tied or bound together in a particular angle. It is also popularly known as the Butterfly
                Pose because of the movement of the legs during the posture, giving the appearance of a butterfly flapping its wings. The posture is also sometimes known as the Cobbler Pose as it resembles the sitting position of a cobbler at work.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit with your spine erect and legs spread straight out.</li>
                <li>Now bend your knees and bring your feet towards the pelvis. The soles of your feet should touch each other.</li>
                <li>Grab your feet tightly with your hands. You may place the hands underneath the feet for support.</li>
                <li>Make an effort to bring the heels as close to the genitals as possible.</li>
                <li>Take a deep breath in. Breathing out, press the thighs and knees downward towards the floor. Make a gentle effort to keep pressing them downward.</li>
                <li>Now start flapping both the legs up and down like the wings of a butterfly. Start slow and gradually increase the speed. Keep breathing normally throughout.</li>
                <li>Fly higher and higher, as fast as you comfortably can. Slow down and then stop. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, bend forward, keeping the chin up and spine erect.</li>
                <li>Press your elbows on the thighs or on the knees, pushing the knees and thighs closer to the floor.</li>
                <li>Feel the stretch in the inner thighs and take long, deep breaths, relaxing the muscles more and more.</li>
                <li>Take a deep breath in and bring the torso up.</li>
                <li>As you exhale, gently release the posture. Straighten the legs out in front of you and relax.</li>

            <h6>Savasana (Corpse Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Savasana is a pose of total relaxation—making it one of the most challenging.</q>
            </div>
            <p>Despite its many benefits for body and mind, more than a few practitioners still view Savasana (Corpse Pose) as an afterthought, the yogic equivalent of the cool-down in an aerobic workout—ideal if you have time but not essential. Also, boring.
                But this final resting pose has a very important purpose in your practice. After using active asanas to stretch, open, and release any tension that might have been in your body, Savasana allows you to integrate the physical practice you
                just completed.<br>Over time, your mind will start to settle, your nervous system will quiet down, and you may even drop into a meditative state during Savasana. Take this time to recalibrate and reset. Your body—and mind—deserve it. </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sit on the floor with your knees bent, feet on the floor. Lean back onto your forearms.</li>
                <li>As you inhale, slowly extend your legs with your feet apart and toes turned out equally.</li>
                <li>Narrow the front of your pelvis and soften (but don’t flatten) your lower back. Lift your pelvis off the floor, slightly tuck your tailbone. (You may use your hand to sweep your buttocks away from your lower back.) Lower your pelvis.</li>
                <li>With your hands, lift the base of your skull away from the back of your neck creating length. If it’s more comfortable, support your head and neck with a folded blanket. Make sure your shoulders are down and away from your ears.</li>
                <li>Reach your arms toward the ceiling, perpendicular to the floor. Rock slightly from side to side and broaden the back ribs and the shoulder blades away from the spine. Then release your arms to the floor, angled evenly away from the sides
                    of the body.</li>
                <li>Turn your arms outward and extend them toward to bottom of the mat. Rest the backs of your hands on the floor. Make sure your shoulder blades rest evenly on the floor.</li>
                <li>Soften your mouth and tongue, and the skin around your nose, ears, and forehead. Let your eyes sink to the back of your head, then turn them downward to gaze toward your heart.</li>
                <li>Stay in this pose for at least 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>To exit, exhale and gentle roll onto one side. Take 2 or 3 breaths. With another exhale, press your hands against the floor and lift your torso, bringing your head slowly after.</li>

            <h6>Purvottanasana (Upward Plank Pose)</h6>
            <div class="quoting">
                <q>Purvottanasana counteracts the effects of Chaturanga by stretching the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and anterior deltoids.</q>
            </div>
            <p>If you frequently practice Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) or take every vinyasa your teacher offers, you’ll develop a strong upper body—and possibly a muscle imbalance. That’s because all of those push-ups cause your chest and shoulders
                to become tighter and your back to become weaker. This can lead to injury—unless you incorporate poses like Purvottanasana (Reverse Plank or Upward Plank Pose) to counterbalance these actions.<br>Purvottanasana asks you to engage just
                about every muscle in your body. Practiced correctly, you’ll stretch tight muscles in your shoulders, chest, and the front of your ankles, while strengthening your arms, wrists, and legs. Upward Plank Pose strengthens your arms, wrists,
                and legs, while stretching your shoulders, chest, and front ankles.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step-by-step Instruction</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin seated in Dandasana (Staff Pose) with your legs extended forward and your hands next to your hips, with your fingertips pointing forward.</li>
                <li>Touch your big toes together and keep a small amount of space between your heels.</li>
                <li>Flex your ankles to draw your toes toward your knees. Press forward with your big toe mounds.</li>
                <li>Rotate your inner thighs down, and firm your outer ankles into your midline.</li>
                <li>Lean back slightly, and slide your hands back about 8 inches.</li>
                <li>As you inhale, move your shoulder blades in, and lift and open your chest.</li>
                <li>As you exhale, point your feet, reach toward the floor with your big toe mounds, and lift your hips.</li>
                <li>Press toward the floor with your big toe mounds. Rotate your inner thighs in and down while you directing your buttocks toward the backs of your knees.</li>
                <li>Press down with your hands to lift your thoracic spine toward your sternum and your sternum toward the ceiling. Inflate your chest.</li>
                <li>Allow your head to drop back, making sure the curve of your neck is a continuation of the curve of your upper back.</li>
                <li>Hold for 5–10 breaths. Press into your feet and hands as you exhale; life your hips and chest as you inhale.</li>
                <li>Release back to the floor.</li>
